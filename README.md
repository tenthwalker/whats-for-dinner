# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
This application helps users choose meal components based on a random selection of options. It takes a user selection via radio buttons and displays a random dish from a corresponding recipe category. It also allows them to clear their selection to try again.

### Installation Instructions:
To get this app running, clone it down from GitHub under the "<> Code" dropdown. Open it from your terminal or preferred CLI with git clone <HTTPS or SSH key>. Move into the directory, open the file in your code editor of choice, and you'll have everything you need! The app can be viewed and interacted with in your browser of choice by using open index.html in your terminal.

### Context:
This project was assigned during Week 3 of Module 1 in Turing's Front-End Engineering track.

### Contributors:
This application was built by [Arden Ranta](https://github.com/tenthwalker/whats-for-dinner).

### Learning Goals:
The goals of this project were to match a provided comp by building CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files from scratch. We also had to respond to user events and practice individualizing our skill set.

These were enacted on a MacBook Pro using GitHub, VS Code, Google Chrome, the Mac Terminal, and Slack.

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins were getting the CSS to at least somewhat cooperate via Flexbox, and prioritizing POM breaks appropriately. Challenges included much of the Javascript functionality interacting correctly with the CSS and HTML I had written. I was able to work through those by seeking fresh eyes from cohortmates and lots of trial and error.
